### Step 5 - discount multiple parcels

ran out of time. 
started on the test
need to factor out a helper for generating the test parcels easily
havent thought too much yet about actual implementation of the discount calculation

### General Todo

* move code into own project seperate from test proj 
* revisit unit tests to align with final functionality so as 1 feature per test. Revisit specific test case examples
* add documentation, exception handling etc
